# Lifelight App

This is a Flutter project. To get started, you'll need to install Flutter and set up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- An IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Installing Flutter

1. Download the stable Flutter SDK from the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Extract the file in an appropriate location on your filesystem.
3. Add `flutter/bin` to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

You can verify your installation by running `flutter doctor` in a terminal. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

## Running the App

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies.
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Start your emulator or connect your device.
5. Run the app.

This should start the app in debug mode. If you want to start the app in release mode, use `flutter run --release`.

## Testing the App

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
flutter test
This will execute all the tests in the test directory.
